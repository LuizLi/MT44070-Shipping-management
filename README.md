# MT44070-Shipping-management
This is the Groupwork files for MT44070

The assignment can be split into three parts:  
a. the cost structure of the vesselsï¼›  
b. the cost structure of the logistics chain;  
c. the impact of using a scrubber or an LNG engine to comply to the ECA zones & the extra cost due to the implementation of FuelEU directive (ETS).

According to the instructions and requirements, the data required for each part has been extracted using the .exe program.

For question a, 23964 TEU is the base vessel, and four smaller vessel are chosen in the database 'Vessel calculation'. Impact of vessel size on cost structure of vessels should be studied.  
For question b, 23964 TEU is the base vessel, and four smaller vessel are chosen in the database 'Chain calculation'. The chain with the lowest cost should be selected. Impact of other vessel size on chain cost should be researched.  
For question c, 23964 TEU is the base vessel, and data with LNG-or-scrubber and scrubber-only propulsion are provided in 'Alternative propulsion'. The impact of choosing for a scrubber instead of a MDO to comply to the ECA zones for a 23964 TEU vessel should be determined. Extra cost due to the implementation of FuelEU directive (ETS) should be studied.
